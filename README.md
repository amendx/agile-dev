### Issues you might face

-  🍌 Lookout for those banana peels on the floor. If you've installed everything correctly and get an error like:

```shell
$ ng is not recognized as an internal or external command
```
- **Don't worry**

> Just run this command: 

```shell
$ alias ng="~/AppData/Roaming/npm/node_modules/@angular/cli/bin/ng"
```
  - This means you'll locally create an instance of angular cli to run its internal commands 🚀
